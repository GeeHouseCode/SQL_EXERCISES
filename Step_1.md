### Step 1, get to know the tables you're working on.
The most important thing is to get to know the data and tables you are working on. There are at least two simple ways :P

```
SELECT TOP (1000) [EmployeeKey]
      ,[ParentEmployeeKey]
      ,[EmployeeNationalIDAlternateKey]
      ,[ParentEmployeeNationalIDAlternateKey]
      ,[SalesTerritoryKey]
      ,[FirstName]
      ,[LastName]
      ,[MiddleName]
      ,[NameStyle]
      ,[Title]
      ,[HireDate]
      ,[BirthDate]
      ,[LoginID]
      ,[EmailAddress]
      ,[Phone]
      ,[MaritalStatus]
      ,[EmergencyContactName]
      ,[EmergencyContactPhone]
      ,[SalariedFlag]
      ,[Gender]
      ,[PayFrequency]
      ,[BaseRate]
      ,[VacationHours]
      ,[SickLeaveHours]
      ,[CurrentFlag]
      ,[SalesPersonFlag]
      ,[DepartmentName]
      ,[StartDate]
      ,[EndDate]
      ,[Status]
      ,[EmployeePhoto]
  FROM [AdventureWorksDW2022].[dbo].[DimEmployee]
```

In this case, I used the SELECT query, which is available after right-clicking on the selected table in SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio). The first 1000 rows will be displayed.

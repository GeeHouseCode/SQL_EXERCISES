## A little bit of teori

SQL (pronounced either “es-cue-el” or “sequel”), which stands for Structured Query Language, is a versatile, open-source query language. It is used to write queries for managing data in structured, relational databases. Some call SQL the “lingua franca” of database management for its versatility, simplicity, and ability to organize and manage large amounts of data in a standardized, tabular format.

Despite there being many alternatives, SQL remains the world’s most widely used database language. SQL forms the basis for next-generation database managers such as Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL and Microsoft T-SQL. For these reasons, SQL skills continue to be in high demand across almost all industries. It can be a key technology for developers, data architects, and data analysts. Even if they use other programs like Excel for data analysis, SQL skills are useful to retrieve the data from databases.

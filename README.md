# SQL_EXERCISES
From Zero To Hero ;P  This repository contains SQL exercises for the purpouse of self learnig and hobby.
## Repository description
This repository is intended to serve as a knowledge base for SQL.
For the purposes of the exercises, the adventureworks database will be used ([link to the website with the database](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=ssms)), and initially 4 tables DimCustomer, FactInternetSales, DimProduct, DimEmployee.
You will find here examples of queries from the simplest to advanced ones, have fun, I hope it will be a helpful.

*Dear reader, this repository contains topics selected by me that I believe will help me consolidate my knowledge by sharing it with others. If you notice any mistakes, please let me know what you think needs to be corrected or modified :P. If you want me to expand on one of the topics of this repository or you just need help, don't hesitate to write to me, together we will definitely be able to solve the problem ;).*

## A little bit of teori

SQL (pronounced either “es-cue-el” or “sequel”), which stands for Structured Query Language, is a versatile, open-source query language. It is used to write queries for managing data in structured, relational databases. Some call SQL the “lingua franca” of database management for its versatility, simplicity, and ability to organize and manage large amounts of data in a standardized, tabular format.

Despite there being many alternatives, SQL remains the world’s most widely used database language. SQL forms the basis for next-generation database managers such as Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL and Microsoft T-SQL. For these reasons, SQL skills continue to be in high demand across almost all industries. It can be a key technology for developers, data architects, and data analysts. Even if they use other programs like Excel for data analysis, SQL skills are useful to retrieve the data from databases.

## Basic SQL commands and aggregation functions
To start your adventure with SQL, you need to know the basic query syntax. Below is a description of the basic commands and aggregation functions.

- **SELECT** - retrieves data from a database
- **FROM** - specifies which table to retrieve data from
- **WHERE** - specifies rows to retrieve based on certain conditions
- **GROUP BY** - groups rows that have the same values in the specified columns
- **HAVING** - filters groups based on a specified condition
- **ORDER BY** - sorts the retrieved rows in a specified order
